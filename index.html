                    <h1>
                        <b>About Self</b>
                    </h1>
                    <p>I am a BTech Computer Science student with a moderate understanding of C programming and a keen
                    interest in
                    expanding my technical skills. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in
                    problem-solving
                    and logical thinking, which I continuously strive to improve. I hold an SPC certificate, showcasing
                    my
                    commitment to professional development and continuous learning.
                    In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong soft skills, including effective time
                    management,
                    teamwork, and communication. I believe that these qualities are essential for success in both
                    academic and
                    professional environments, as they enable me to work efficiently in group settings, manage multiple
                    tasks
                    effectively, and convey ideas clearly.
                    I am highly motivated to learn and grow, always seeking opportunities to explore new concepts and
                    technologies
                    in the field of computer science. Beyond academics, I enjoy reading books, which helps me gain new
                    perspectives and enhance my knowledge. I also have a passion for watching movies, as they allow me
                    to unwind
                    and appreciate storytelling from different cultures and genres.
                    With a proactive approach to learning and a strong commitment to personal and professional growth, I
                    am eager
                    to contribute my skills and knowledge to meaningful projects and future career opportunities.
